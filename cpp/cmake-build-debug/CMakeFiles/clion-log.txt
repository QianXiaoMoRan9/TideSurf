CMake Warning at /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/arrow/Findre2Alt.cmake:25 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findre2.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "re2", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "re2" with any of
  the following names:

    re2Config.cmake
    re2-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "re2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "re2_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "re2" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
